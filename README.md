# FirstJavaFXCalculator
This is my first javaFX app and first project on GitHub.
It's a simple calculator which perform just one basic Math operation.

Following changes expected in next update:
1) More changes in GUI, colored Non-Digit buttons
2) Clear Button to clear previous calculation
3) App Logo and Title
4) displaying more accurate results as right now it returns result in int(Long)
5) Comments and Console output would be added to display the code flow
